[features]
# `sync` utilizes an Arc instead of an Rc for JMESPath runtime variables.
# Using an Arc allows you to share compiled expressions across threads.
sync = []
# `specialized` enables the use of specialization for more efficient code
# however at time of writing it is unstable & so requires a nightly compiler.
# See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844 for the latest status.
